- visualization is laggy:
  this could be enhanced by adding threads.  it's due to the current design's
  time resolution not being accurate enough.

- volume is not retained across restarts:
  we could save our preferred volume as a preference.

- in some instances, roaraudio may suspend itself and our connection is lost:
  we can send roar_noop() every so often to keep the connection and soundserver
  alive.
