This is a terrible port from XMMS to Audacious.

It's a horrible hack, and the ./configure scripts do more damage than 
good.  Hopefully it will work for most, though patches for ./configure 
are more than welcome!

In fact, patches of any kind are welcome since it's a total hack and 
magic that it works as-is.
