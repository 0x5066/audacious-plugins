The following things are not implemented yet.

- mixer support
- prerolling: this means that it is possible for buffer underruns occasionally.
  we want to preroll at least 50% of buffer_size before actually writing anything
  to the soundcard.

The following things would be nice:

- use HAL (or DeviceKit) to match up devices and mixer settings. The old way sucks
  majorly, I want to be able to just choose a soundcard and have it set up the mixer
  the right way on it's own. This is 2009, and this should be possible.
