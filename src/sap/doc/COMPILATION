COMPILATION REQUIREMENTS
------------------------

To compile the plugin you need:

 - gcc/g++ and at least libc6 2.1.x with POSIX pthreads 
   and a linux or *BSD system

     TESTED:
     linux/x86 (gcc 2.95.2 and glibc 2.1.3) - compiles cleanly, works OK
     linux/x86 (gcc 2.95.4 and glibc 2.2.5) - compiles cleanly, works OK
     linux/alpha (gcc 3.2.2 and glibc 2.2.5) - compiles cleanly, works OK 

 - xmms (of course :)), libxmms,libxmms-devel
    
     TESTED:
     xmms 1.2.7 - OK
     REPORTED:
     xmms 1.2.8 - OK
     
 - gtk,gtk-devel, glib,glib-devel 
    
     TESTED:
     gtk+ 1.2.10 glib 1.2.10 - OK
     REPORTED
     gtk+ 1.2.8 glib 1.2.8 - OK

    
COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------

NOTE: Since I cannot have access to as many platforms as linux runs on, I need the 
information about copilation issues on different machines/oses/architectures. 
Just compile it! If it fails drop me a line with info on your system, 
compiler and glibc versions.
If it compiles OK, and you use something different than the software / platform
mentioned above as TESTED, I need the info even more. Please be helpful ;)

To compile just do a 'make && make install' in the plugin source dir.
That's it. Enjoy!
