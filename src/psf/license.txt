and right to distribute the following files:

  SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

The warranter has come to this conclusion for the following reasons:

* No copyright statements are present directly in the files;
* Authorship statements, while present are attributed to unidentifiable
  pseudonyms which cannot be traced;

Due to the above, it is reasonable to assume that the individual files in
question have been placed into the public domain.

Rightsholders which wish to be identified and/or challenge this decision
should file a bug at http://jira.atheme.org/.  Code which is challenged will
be replaced in the next development cycle.
