This Audacious Media Player plug-in is a part of the TTA audio
compressor which performs lossless compression on multichannel
8,16 and 24-bit data of the wav audio files. Being "lossless"
means that no data/quality is lost in the compression - when
uncompressed, the data will be identical to the original.

At now, mostly all of the popular lossless compressors gives a same
compression results (difference about 1-3%). TTA is a hardware-
oriented format. It means that the TTA format has a reasonable
